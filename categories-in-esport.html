        <p>Due to the enormous variety that exist in gaming esports is more of
          an
          umbrella term that something that explain one specific sport. These
          variations construct themselves in a lot different ways like
          perspectives,
          gameplay styles, number of players, platforms, and with hardware such
          as
          controllers. Due to this there are several categories inside esports
          that
          are completely different from each other and require wholly different
          skills.

          Given that on this page we hope to give you a quick but informative
          overview
          of different types of games in esports and examples inside those
          categories.

        <h2>First person shooter (FPS)</h2>
        <p>First-person shooter (FPS) is a type of video game that puts players
          in the perspective of the main character, who is typically armed with
          some kind of weapon. The goal of an FPS game is usually to move
          through a series of levels and eliminate enemies using the weapon. The
          game is played from a first-person perspective, meaning that the
          player sees the game world through the eyes of the main character.
          Aiming the weapon you shoot is seen as one of the most important
          skills in FPS with many games in the category requiring good aim as to
          be describes as good at the game.

        <h2>Real time strategy (RTS)</h2>
        <p>Real-time strategy (RTS) is a type of video game that challenges
          players
          to build and manage a base while controlling their units in a battle
          against other players. The game is played in real-time, meaning that
          the
          action unfolds continuously, and players must make decisions and issue
          orders to their units on the fly. This type of game is different from
          turn-based strategy games, in which players take turns to make their
          moves.
          StarCraft is the quint essential example of this and has been in
          esports
          for decades.

          SOCOM series, a tactical military shooter in the early 2000s which
          later influenced Counter Strike, albeit a first-person shooter. It
          relied on using typical military arsenal and tactics to overcome
          opponents. Though not as common now in the scene, Gears of War,
          alongside Halo and Call of Duty, notable first-person shooters, was
          among the most played in American Major League Gaming late in the
          2000s as a team-based shooter.

          opponent draw cards with different functions to outwit each other.
