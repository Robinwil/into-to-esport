					<a href="https://influencermarketinghub.com/esports-stats/">The
						eSports
						industry</a></h2> has seen tremendous growth over the
				years, both
				<p>in terms of
					viewership and revenue. The increasing viewership is what
					mainly
					contributed to the revenue growth - and it's not just
					because
					those viewers
					are generating revenue. Seeing the potential of reaching a
					large
					and
					engaged audience, brands are investing in eSports marketing,
					both
					directly and indirectly. This has contributed to rapid
					revenue
					growth in
					the industry, only slowed down by COVID limiting significant
					public eSports
					events, although things seem to be returning to normal in
					2022.
				</p>
				<p>
					The future of all sports is esports. That may sound like a
					bold
					statement
					<a
						href="https://uk.news.yahoo.com/esports-future-sports-heres-why-154501097.html?">
						but there is growing evidence to support it.</a> Today’s
					spectators and
					participants expect to be digitally engaged while they
					watch.
					And the most
					effective way to deliver digital engagement is through
					“gamification” - the
					transformation of watching into playing..
				</p>
				<p>
					So, if you too are only learning about the world of eSports
					and
					are looking
					to see what all the hype is all about, read on to find out
					more
					about some
					of the most noteworthy reasons this industry became so
					popular,
					so fast.
				</p>
				<p>
					Many believe this will lead to a tectonic shift in media
					distribution, IP
					monetisation and advertising. Three core elements are
					contributing to the
					esports industry’s rise as the next major spectator sport:
					streamed
					competitions with organised leagues, professional players
					whose
					efforts can
					be viewed anywhere, and live events in major offline sports
					venues. It’s
					why platforms such as Twitch, where people from all over the
					world can tune
					in and watch gamers, or “streamers,” play video games, is
					the
					largest live
					streaming platform in the US. In 2014,Amazon bought Twitch
					for
					nearly $1 billion, though some business analysts questioned
					the
					move.
					Today, Twitch has approximately 5 million active viewers who
					spend 106
					minutes each day watching live gaming, which ranks higher
					than
					prime time
					cable TV networks like CNN.

					<a href="https://influencermarketinghub.com/esports-stats/">Digital
						culture
						is redefining</a> what sport means and young people are
					redefining what
					‘playing sport’ entails. The esports world is made up of
					competitive,
					tournament-led video gaming, with professional leagues, mass
					spectatorship
					and significant sponsors. Additionally, eSports is actually
					more
					inclusive
					and more easily accessible than any other sport. In the
					world of
					eSports,
					anyone can become a champion, regardless of their age,
					gender or
					physical
					ability. Of course, in order to become the best of the best,
					you
					will still
					need to practice intensely. But this form of practice not
					only
					guarantees
					hours upon hours of great fun, but it’s also significantly
					less
					demanding
					and intense from the physical point of view. Here, it won’t
					really matter
					if you’re the biggest or the toughest player on the field,
					as
					all of the
					participants are more or less equal in the digital world.

					How to get into Esports
				</h2><img alt="Photo of CS:GO team winning Intel Exreme Masters"
					class="center" src="images/4.JPG">
				<p>
					The first thing you’ll need to do is pick your game(s).
					Before
					looking into
					the biggest events of the year, <a
						href="https://www.redbull.com/ca-en/how-to-get-into-esports">first
						decide what
						sorts of games you want to watch.</a> Take a look at
					what
					you like to play
					as well as what you understand and go from there. Start by
					sampling a few
					games you think you might be interested in. You need to
					really
					enjoy the
					game you choose because you’ll be watching and (probably)
					playing a lot of
					it. Games are separated by genres in esports with some of
					the
					biggest ones
					being fighting, first-person shooters (FPS), multiplayer
					online
					battle
					arena (MOBA), collectible card games (CCG) and real-time
					strategy (RTS).
				</p>
				<p>
					A good place to start playing, most of the time, is right in
					the
					games
					you’ve chosen to keep tabs on. A lot of games have ranked
					modes
					online that
					match you with other players around your skill level. You
					could
					also join a
					club or a team at your school, local gaming centre or any
					other
					organization that has open bracket events for you to
					participate
					in. More
					on this later.
				</p>
				<p>
					Leagues such as FACEIT is <a
						href="https://dignitas.gg/articles/getting-noticed-by-pro-teams-on-faceit-a-csgo-guide-with-dignitasvie-heap">
						much more than just a PUG platform</a> - it’s also home
					to
					the majority of
					the open qualifiers that give access to big international
					tournaments for
					teams that manage to go through them. And even on those,
					your
					FACEIT level
					can impact the players you face. If most of your team is
					level
					10, you’re
					most likely to face a lower leveled team in the first round
					due
					to
					automatic seeding - that’s just one of the reasons why
					ranking
					up is so
					important, in case you’re trying to make it a career.

					The Relevance Of Esports in School today
				</h2><img alt="Crazy fan" class="center" src="images/3.JPG">
				<p>
					Esports in school is catching on as the popularity of
					esports
					continues to
					grow. And while research shows that participation in school
					activities
					improves students’ performance and overall well-being,
					parents
					and
					educators have resisted the idea of organized esports in
					schools. But based
					on current trends, that may be set to change for the better.
					As
					starting an
					esports team in school therefore can be daunting, you can
					learn
					how to set
					up one in our upcoming and complete guide.
